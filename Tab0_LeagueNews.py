                Only two weeks remain for the league and the standings are tight. Everything is still to play for, but the focus of this article is the potential action on the tracks coming up this week. While there are only two weeks left, there are three races and two Sprints scheduled for our drivers. The first of this week’s races will take place in Abu Dhabi at the Yas Marina Circuit which was made infamous for providing Max Verstappen’s first Driver’s Championship victory. The second race of the week takes the drivers to Austria to rip around the Red Bull Ring, not once, but twice in a Sprint and main race.

                Let’s tackle the twists and turns of Yas Marina first. The start finish straight is a short one, but it leads into a medium braking corner and two full tilt turns just after that. Once drivers are up to speed they are met with a wide hairpin that could allow for some early passing and late stage desperation. Once the harrowing overtaking is done in Turn 5, drivers will face the long back straight where lead cars will be at risk of being overtaken into the Turn 6 & 7 chicance. But drivers who play their cards right should be able to battle back immediately after the chicane with the second DRS zone heading into the sweeping Turn 9. The middle of Sector 3 is where the drivers will earn their paychecks as they face the extremely technical hotel section and the challenging braking zones of the final two turns.

                In the prior two seasons McLaren’s Nick has found himself successful around Yas Marina Circuit, winning both of the races. Alpine’s Joshua and retired driver Mark have both found themselves on the second step of the podium once, and Ferrari’s Erick has found himself on the podium in third place during both of those instances

                Now let’s review the opportunities the drivers will have at the Red Bull Ring, the shortest track on the league’s calendar this season. Even though the Red Bull Ring is rather short, it is not short of challenging turns and passing opportunities. As the drivers floor it up the steep front straight and into the first turn, some drivers may be given the opportunity to jump the inside line or, if they have a grip advantage, take the outside line for an overtake. The drivers will then head down and back up the twisting DRS zone up to Turn 3. Here drivers will have their best opportunity for overtaking throughout the race. Pinching off their opponents, drivers will then open their back wings again on the back straight down to Turn 4. As the elevation begins to change the drivers will sweep around Turns 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in quick succession. The brave, or maybe the foolish, may try overtaking on the outside of these turns if they have the grip and pace. Then the last two turns on the track will rear their ugly heads. If drivers are cautious they will stay within the white lines, but knowing this league, expect to see time penalties being handed out left, right, and center on the exits of each of the last two turns.

                This will be the first Sprint with the revised format and rules that were proposed and ratified after the Sprint in China. The league will qualify in a shortened Sprint qualifying style. This means that each lap of qualifying will matter just a touch more. From there the drivers will line up for the Sprint in the order they qualified and rip it around the Red Bull Ring at full tilt with little to no regard to tires or strategy. With the dust settled the drivers will be lined back up for the main race. However, the starting grid will be set in reverse from the results of the Sprint. There are a few minor exceptions for the reverse grid which are listed below.
                > 1) All drivers will line up behind _ALL_ AI regardless of the position the AI finished in during the Sprint.
                > 2) Any driver that DNF or DNS the Sprint will line up behind the drivers that did start and finish the Sprint.

                With all that said, last time out where the hills are alive with the sound of racecars, the league saw the now Ferrari driver Del hoist the winner’s trophy. The season before that, Nick was on the top step of the podium. The following steps of the podium have seen Nick and now Aston Martin driver Zane in second as well as Joshua and Erick in third.

Tire strategies was the hottest goss on the track at the start of the race with Brently running the hards and literally everyone else running the mediums. However it turned out fine for him as he was able to battle through the Tavera sibling squabble and come out on the podium in third.

                    Nick and Del played nice together in the Italian sunshine and managed to tow each other all the way until the last few laps where Bottas decided he didn’t really like Del after all, blocking him and sealing the win for Nick.

The Canadian GP is well known for its infamous Wall of Champions, but for the league’s drivers, it became synonymous with corner cutting and time penalties.

On the flip side, the McLaren drivers Nick and Travis were extremely precise and managed to make it through the race without a corner dutting penalty. But, Nick wasn’t able to keep it completely clean, during the lone Virtual Safety Car of the race he was caught out just over the requisite delta and received a drive through penalty which may have cost him the race.

                    The race wasn’t all sunshine and penalties though. Sometime during the 13th lap, the heavens opened. Rain began to pitter patter down onto the track, cooling both surface and tire temperatures. Drivers began diving into the pits, opting for intermediate tires to lessen the difficulty of driving on the slick track. As the rain continued nearly everyone went in for intermediate tires. However, as the rain began to lighten up, some drivers gambled and swapped to slicks early. This proved to be an effective way to bring the slicks in gradually, but it was also tough sledding for a few laps as grip was nowhere to be found.

As the race began they stayed out of each other’s ways, but as tire strategies and the weather pulled the two closer together, disaster struck. Alpine’s Eddie and Ferrari’s Erick wrestled back and forth for position. Just after Eddie overtook Erick in the back straight, the two sped into Turn 1 and Turn 2 where Eddie was too early on the throttle, oversteering his car perpendicular to the racing line. Erick, even with his incredible F1 reflexes that got him his seat at Ferrari, was unable to avoid slamming directly into Eddie’s sidepod. Both drivers recovered from the mishap with only lost time and hurt egos. However, Eddie’s teammate Joshua likely will find a bruise on his ego after an unforced error in Turn 7 had him spinning out and losing places.

        st.subheader("INSIDER SCOOP: ***Red Bull's Drama in the Pits***")
        st.markdown('''
                    As the season has progressed, it is clear that Red Bull has not been able to perform at the level they initially planned. During the most recent outing in Canada, it appears that the season has completely spiraled out of control, and now the gloves, and wheels, are off. What was once a well-oiled machine of racing dominance has devolved into a spectacle of frustration, failure, and outright calamity.

                    In the latest catastrophe, a radio failure severed communication between Bositive and his pit crew at the worst possible time. Tire sensors failed, leaving the engineers blind to the car’s conditions. Yet, despite the wet conditions, the crew insisted on fitting hard tires, forcing Boz to wrestle a car that slid helplessly across the circuit. Desperation mounted, and as the weather turned, Boz called for soft compounds. In a shocking blunder, wet tires were thrown on instead. The result? Four chaotic pit stops, lost time, and a furious Boz left screaming into the void of radio silence as Red Bull’s race fell apart before their eyes. Red Bull did not just struggle with Boz during this race, Yeti was a no show throughout the event, leaving the team grasping at the few points Boz could secure. 

                    After the race, Boz let loose in the media pen with a fiery post-race critique:

                    > _**This team can’t fix anything right. They need to get it together and stop relying on old data from past years—what worked then doesn’t work now. They need to start focusing on what’s happening on the track, in real time. Nobody is listening to me, and it’s costing us everything. I’m out there fighting for every second, and these mistakes are unacceptable. Something has to change, or this season should be considered finished before it even began.**_

                    The frustration didn’t end with words. After the race, an enraged Bositive stormed into the garage and threw his helmet against the wall, the sound echoing across the pit lane as team members stood frozen. It was the perfect symbol of a driver at his breaking point, furious at a team that seems unable to deliver when it matters most. Red Bull’s once-golden reputation is now hanging by a thread as the tension between driver and crew reaches an all-time high.

                    Canada’s disaster follows the heartbreaking collapse in Baku, where a critical engineering miscalculation turned a potential podium into a fiery wreck. Clinging to third position, down to 5th, Red Bull stubbornly kept Boz on medium tires, ignoring his growing concerns. The decision proved fatal—on the final turn before the straight, the car lost grip, slid out of control, and smashed into the wall in a devastating crash. What could have been a triumphant finish, instead became another glaring symbol of a team in freefall.

                    With every race, Red Bull’s struggles grow deeper, and Boz’s fury becomes impossible to ignore. The once-dominant team now finds itself not just losing races, but losing its identity. Strategic failures, technical disasters, and broken trust have left Red Bull limping from race to race. Rumor has it that even McLaren has offered Boz a life line. The team has opened their practice session up to the driver, but so far no confirmed participation has occurred.

With the standings as close as they are, no one can afford a major mishap here. With respect to the Constructor’s Championship, Red Bull will be looking to overtake Aston Martin, McLaren will be looking to overtake Alpine, and both Ferrari and VCARB will be poised to capitalize on any opportunity afforded them. Drivers like Alpine’s Eddie, Ferrari’s Erick, and Red Bull’s Yeti will all be looking to get on the offensive and overtake their nearest rivals. While drivers like Ferrari’s Zane, Aston Martin’s Del, and VCARB’s Patrick will all be looking to further themselves in the standings from those just behind them.

This will likely remain a hot topic going into future races.

                    With the past in the proverbial rearview mirror, cars roared to life, however, some garages stayed silent. For the first time, the league went into a qualifying session with only half of the drivers. Some are saying drivers deliberately boycotted the race due to its location, while others are reporting that many of the drivers were simply too scared to take to the tightly walled streets of Baku. Regardless, after qualifying finished the drivers who were in attendance made up the first three rows of the grid. McLaren and VCARB both had season best qualifying sessions as teams, while Alpine’s Eddie and Red Bull’s Boz really showed up for their teams with their best qualifying performances of the year.

                    Just in the nick of time, Aston Martin’s Del arrived at the paddock and entered into the race in 20th. Which meant the grid was finalized and it was time to rocket down the long straights of Baku. Notably, the grid was set without both Erick and Zane’s Ferraris, Gary’s Aston Martin, Yeti’s Red Bull, and Joshua’s Alpine. When the lights went out, most drivers got reasonable starts, and the front runners held their positions through the first corner. Positions swapped, tire strategies came into play, and a few minor incidents occurred throughout the first half of the race.

                    But just as the race passed the halfway point, the first safety car of the evening occurred. The primary strategy of the race had been a single stop from the hard compound to the medium compound. Therefore, most drivers were not ready to risk extending a new set of mediums for half of the race. So with most drivers staying out, the safety car parade began. However Eddie, who had been running in second, had a damaged front wing and required a pitstop. But either because he was screaming about something Marvel Rivals related over the radio or because his pit crew was worn out from dealing with all the spinouts during qualifying, Alpine did not swap his wing. This error forced Eddie to pit again on the following lap, still under safety car. 

                    While tumbling backwards in position, Eddie prepared for the race restart on new tires with a fresh front wing. Many of the drivers were positioned near the front of the queue and began to spar in the tight turns of the circuit’s first sector. However, after a lap, there were again no major incidents. The drivers were keeping it as civil as they could with the occasional “I’m gonna dive bomb you,” being shouted from those trying to make up positions. As the sparring continued, Del unfortunately met an early demise which led to the second safety car of the evening.

                    With a few of the front runners hoping to stretch their original tires for a chance at fresh softs, a risky choice became clear, pit now for mediums, or hold out for softs later. Nick made the decision to pit for the medium compound tires and gamble that he could get through all of the traffic from halfway down the field. This decision put VCARB’s Patrick, Red Bull’s Boz, and Alpine’s Eddie in the top three at the onset of the restart. On the front stretch the drivers took off and Eddie managed to get past Boz within a lap or two. During that time, Nick came screaming up the ranks and managed to position himself into third. As Patrick, Eddie, Nick, and Boz entered the castle section, Eddie made a race losing mistake. With a minor lapse in concentration he spun at the top of the castle turns and collided nose first with the right wall. Nick narrowly avoided clipping his rear, but as Eddie began to get off of the racing line he blocked Boz’s path causing an additional collision.

                    Eddie and Boz would recover from this and manage to finish the race at the back of the pack, even with some last corner shenanigans. Due to a drive through penalty gained during the safety car and a collision caused by Perez, VCARB’s Brently finished in the middle of the field. McLaren’s Travis was also caught out due to the Perez-Brently incident but managed to finish the race as well. So with one driver off to the shores of the Caspian Sea, and four drivers out of the points, it came down to reigning champion Nick and rookie driver Patrick.

With his battery depleted, Patrick was only able to defend up to the finish line where Nick overtook going into the final lap, therefore all but securing another win for himself and McLaren. Nick’s win along with Travis’ performance brings McLaren within two points of Alpine in the Constructor’s Championship. Red Bull and Aston Martin are now within one point of one another in the battle for 5th. This win also pushes Nick an entire race win ahead of Joshua in the Driver’s Championship, and Patrick’s second place pushed him ahead of Erick for third.

                    Upon further review the drop of 5 places was deemed too harsh for the punishment under the circumstances of the incident.

                    The FIA directors have determined a 3 place drop is more fitting in this instance. Therefore, the standings of the race are updated as shown below, effective immediately.

                    It has been an eventful few days since the league’s first Sprint race. A major FIA decision was made that changed the results of the race, and let’s just say there has not been this much rioting since the 1991 Chicago Bulls celebration riots. Some drivers put pen to paper to rip into the FIA’s decision for being abrupt and unfair. While other drivers defended the decision as it upheld aspects of racing sportsmanship they appreciate. Alpine’s start driver Joshua ended his tirade by saying:

                    > _**This is really BS and unfair.** - Joshua_
                    
                    The next day, Joshua spoke to a local reporter and stated:

                    > _**Everyone better watch out because we are coming for blood [in Baku]. [The decision is] Not fair but we move forward.** - Joshua_

                    His teammate Eddie took an interview with a Houston based reporter where he labelled the FIA as blind while elaborating on the situation between he and Joshua:

                    > _**While yes I do admit to running Josh off the road, which I did get a penalty for on top of my other 5-grid penalty (which resulted in me having a 10-grid penalty already), Joshua also got a 5-grid penalty from that for no exact reason. Due to the FIA not having eye balls, Joshua already had to push harder and try stupider sh*t just to make it back to his true position, P1. This all resulted in his situation during the Sprint race. He should not be penalized further, when he was already penalized and is getting penalized for a rule which was never stated before the race.** - Eddie_

                    Other drivers like the VCARB pair were more ceremonious and in agreement with the FIA’s decision. Patrick was heard screaming, “I’m a winner!” as far away as Erick’s house. The shouts were measured on local seismology equipment as a 3.2 magnitude earthquake on the Richter Scale. His teammate Brently was more subdued with his commentary stating:

                    > _**I feel like it was the right decision. As it seemed odd when and where he retired [in the Sprint].** - Brently_

                    Multiple teams have also released formal statements which can be found at the end of this article. More importantly, this ruling shakes up the standings quite a bit. Joshua dropped below McLaren’s Nick in the Driver’s Championship and VCARB closed even further on McLaren in the Constructor’s Championship.

                    With all this said, it’s time to focus on the upcoming street race in Baku. Drivers will be met with close walls, the longest pedal to the metal straight on the calendar, and deviously challenging combinations of undulation and corners. Sector 1 is essentially three flatout straights with ninety-degree left turns at the end of each. If drivers survive that, they will quickly find themselves at the beginning of the most challenging sector on the league’s calendar. The castle section and Turn 15 have caught out many talented drivers before and are certainly capable of wreaking havoc on the race this week. Sector 3 is a drafters paradise, but the exit of Turn 16 will make or break any challenger’s attack on their rivals.

                    The Alternative F124 League’s independent FIA directors have issued a decision regarding an incident that occurred during the recent Chinese Grand Prix, resulting in a five-place grid penalty for driver Joshua. 

                    Following an extensive review of race footage and telemetry data, it has been determined that Joshua retired his car during the sprint race despite no terminal damage, with the intention of improving his starting position for the main race—set to be held in reverse order of the sprint race results. This behavior was deemed to be in violation of league regulations.

                    In comparison, Patrick, who also sustained damage during the sprint, made the decision to repair his car and continue racing, ultimately putting in a solid performance to finish the race.

                    As a result of the penalty, Joshua will drop from 1st to 6th in the final results. The revised finishing positions from the Chinese Grand Prix are as follows:

                    - 1st: Patrick  
                    - 2nd: Erick  
                    - 3rd: Nick  
                    - 4th: Eddie  
                    - 5th: Boz  
                    - 6th: Joshua  

                    Joshua has the right to appeal this decision to the independent FIA directors, David and Marcus, should he wish to contest the ruling. The Alternative F124 League remains committed to upholding fair and competitive racing for all participants.

The abbreviated qualifying sessions led to a new pole sitter for the Sprint, with VCARB’s Patrick setting the pace. McLaren’s Nick took the other slot on the front row after current Driver’s Championship leader, Alpine’s Joshua, saw a five place grid penalty drop him to sixth. Once the lights were out, the driver’s sprung to life and cruised through the first few corners of the track. Coming out of Turn 6, Nick took the lead of the race after a small racing incident. There was no looking back for him after that as he built a substantial gap and took home the win, while Nick’s gap built, Patrick battled back from the incident, but ended the race in 18th due to what can only be described as a calculated bit of revenge from Ferrari’s Erick who closed the door on him into Turn 1.

Chaos ensued throughout the race as contenders started on the back row and were forced into making daring passes to make up ground on Joshua. From crazy maneuvers off the starting line to more Turn 6 shenanigans, drivers were pushing to the limit of the rules and what the cars can provide to make up ground early. Nick was a big winner early on in the race, but Erick was also able to make up ground throughout the first stint. It was clear that two major strategies were in play. For the front runners, a two stop plan was the consensus and for those starting in the back a one stop strategy allowed them to extend and make up places against the two stoppers.

However as the hairpin approached and braking began, Erick pulled out of his attack and caused himself to brake too late and into the runoff.

Additionally, spectators were given a show of talent as the drivers completed the most overtakes of the season, nearly doubling the total number of overtakes from all the previous races combined.

                    With every car across the line, Joshua took home another win, with Patrick and Erick just behind. Nick crossed in third, but due to penalties acquired while overtaking the backfield he ended up falling to Erick who was just a few seconds behind. The Driver’s Championship saw VCARB teammates swap places, while the Constructor’s Championship saw the VCARB outfit grow ever closer to jumping into second place.

All-in-all an incredible outing full of high energy, a tasteful bit of cyberbullying, and stellar driving performances.

Not only will a standard race occur on Wednesday, the league will face its first ever Sprint race. If that wasn’t enough, league officials have devised an exciting plan to bring some variety to the race week. Drivers will face a standard three session qualifying to help set the grid for the Sprint. From there the drivers will complete a short stint of laps around the circuit at full tilt to score points. The results of the Sprint race will be used to set the grid order for the race, in reverse. That’s right, qualifying, Sprint, and the main race grid set in reverse off of the results of the Sprint. The format is sure to force drivers into daring passing scenarios, fingers crossed everyone keeps it between the white lines.

                    So how much does this race matter? With the added 8 points available from the Sprint race, the Driver’s Championship can turn topsy-turvy, especially with the added suspense of the reverse grid. With respect to the Constructor’s Championship, nearly every team has the ability to make up ground or even leap-frog the current leader. As we adjourn this race week update, let’s take a look at the results of yesteryear. Last season saw McLaren’s Nick take home the win, with the then Mercedes driver, now Aston Martin driver, Del stepping up to the second step of the podium, and the then Red Bull driver, now Ferrari driver, Zane bringing home third. However, with two wins up for grabs and the new format almost anything is possible.

                    **Two Tracks**
                    
                    Drivers took on two high speed, long, and arduous tracks. First, the league started at Spa where a surprise qualifying occurred with both Kick Sauber cars out pacing all of the drivers by leaps and bounds. However, neither Kick car was able to fend off the league’s drivers for more than a few laps. As the race continued a few safety cars brought the field together which allowed McLaren’s Nick to take home his second win of the season, with Alpine’s Joshua coming in second, and Aston Martin’s Del taking home his second podium of the season. Notably, both Del and VCARB’s Brently made up multiple places over the course of the race. After the race the midfield standings saw a few changes. In the Constructor’s Championship VCARB overtook Ferrari. While in the Driver’s Championship Brently overtook VCARB’s Patrick, Del overtook Ferrari’s Zane, and Red Bull’s Boz separated from Aston Martin’s Gary.

                    After a quick break the league strapped in for 33 laps in Barcelona, Spain. Qualifying saw Nick outpace Ferrari’s Erick by a thin margin. However at the end of the race, Joshua ended up taking home the victory, with Nick just behind, and Erick rounding out the podium. Just like in Spa, the race was full of turmoil but also a notable performance by Red Bull’s Yeti. Starting in 14th, Yeti ripped through the field, passing nearly every contender and battling all the way up into 5th place for his best finish of the season. Yeti’s notable performance resulted in the only change in the championship standings, with him overtaking Zane.

                    **Tons of Turmoil**

                    With the important updates out of the way, let’s get into the drama from the double header. First and foremost, the FIA was under fire again with numerous penalties granted to drivers in Spa for exceeding track limits. So much so, and to the delight of corner cutters everywhere, the regulators decided to loosen up on their penalty calls while in Spain.

                    With plenty of penalties awarded for track limits, the FIA was surprisingly quiet when it came to penalizing aggressive drivers who ran their competitors off track. Right out of the gate in Spa, Joshua took an assertive position on the exit of Turn 1, forcing Nick off track on their way down to Eau Rogue. Within the next lap, Joshua chose to slow down and allow Nick to pass in a gesture of good faith and motor-sportsmanship. Unfortunately, this was not the only incident where a driver ended up off track. While battling, Erick began an attack on Patrick on the outside of the main start-finish straight. Patrick, unaware of how far Erick had advanced, held his line, and forced Erick to take drastic actions on the grass and gravel runaway of Turn 1. After review, neither incident was deemed sufficient enough for further penalty to any driver.

                    Spa also delivered two extraordinarily long safety cars. The first was caused by Erick losing control at the top of Eau Rogue. Nearly all the drivers immediately pitted for new tires and queued up behind the insanely erratic safety car. Alpine’s Eddie found himself in front of his teammate Joshua and attempted to provide a meaningful position swap at the restart, more on this later. This maneuver, along with a poorly contrived passing attempt by Patrick, ended with another safety car after Patrick accidentally pit maneuvered Yeti, log jamming the whole field (except Erick who made up 12 places in one turn).

                    Safety cars were a theme in both races. While in Spain the drivers faced a relatively early safety car at the end of Lap 13. Many drivers pitted, and committed to tire saving throughout the race. The restart was mostly uneventful with nominal slipstream passes and great battles due to the grouped up drivers. One such battle occurred between Nick, Patrick, and Erick headed into La Caixa at the beginning of Sector 3. In what can only be described as an act of vengeance, Erick forgot to brake and nearly sideswiped Patrick and t-boned Nick. However, he gently grazed both drivers and neither incurred any damage.

                    Spain ended with one last bit of turmoil as Joshua began to tout his fastest lap streak. Conveniently, Patrick was on a two stopper with his final stint on the soft compound tires. With a full battery, fresh tires, and fuel low, Patrick changed his engine mode and pushed, securing the fastest lap of the race for the moment. In spite of the time set, a pair of teammates were determined to try and take the fastest lap, more on this later.

                    **Terrible Teamwork**

                    While not terrible, a few teammates were unable to race one or both races which resulted in some of the standings changes mentioned previously. But, remarkably terrible teamwork came out of the French outfit in both races. While lapping through the Ardennes Forest, Joshua ended up behind Eddie during the first safety car. The two conjured up the idea to let Joshua by on the shortest straight of the track coming out of the slowest corner on the track. This failed miserably as Joshua jumped the gun and Eddie forgot where his accelerator was. Causing Yeti, Patrick, Joshua, and Eddie to be 4-wide coming across the DRS activation line. The league watched it back like an end of year fail recap from a mildly unsuccessful sim racing streamer. Laughs were shared, teammates yelled at one another, and it felt like we were back at the Christmas Eve dining table listening to family debate meaningless politics, knowing full well how silly the whole scenario is.

                    Now if that were the only silly teammate moment, this article would be done. But, as you can see, it isn’t. As previously mentioned Joshua had won the fastest lap award at every single race this season. But in Spain, Patrick had a prime opportunity to snag a fastest lap near the end of the race. Joshua, afraid to lose his victory, did not pit and try to retaliate, instead, he had his teammate Eddie pit and attempt to snag the fastest lap. They tried new tires, slipstreaming, and what some are calling “coaching,” but to no avail. Joshua’s streak ended and on the last lap the Alpine pair were at each other’s throats.

The Red Bull pairing failed to make it out of Q1 and Alpine’s #2 driver Eddie totaled his car beyond repair, making it impossible for him to set a lap time during Q2. The final results of Q3 saw Alpine’s Joshua take home another pole position, with McLaren’s Nick, Aston Martin’s Del, and VCARB’s Patrick completing the first two rows. The Ferrari pairing occupied the third row and McLaren’s Travis and VCARB’s Brently rounded out the top eight on the fourth row of the grid.
